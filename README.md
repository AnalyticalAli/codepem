# CodePen Clone

A **CodePen Clone** built with **React** that lets users write and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time, similar to the popular CodePen platform.

## Features

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Editors**: Write and edit code in separate sections.
- **Live Preview**: See the output instantly in an iframe.
- **Run Button**: Execute the code to update the preview.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Save code in local storage to continue from where you left off.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the app.
- **Local Storage**: To store and retrieve code across sessions.
- **Custom Components**: Modular and reusable components for the code editors.
